LuaTeX-ko Package version 3.6 (2023/09/11)
===========================================

This is a Lua(La)TeX macro package that supports typesetting Korean
documents including Old Hangul texts. As LuaTeX has opened up access to
almost all the hidden routines of TeX engine, users can obtain more
beautiful outcome using this package rather than other Hangul packages
operating on other engines.

LuaTeX version 1.10+ and luaotfload package version 2.96+ are required for
this package to run.

This package also requires cjk-ko package for its full functionality.

Loading
-------

For a LaTeX user, declaring

    \usepackage{luatexko}
or

    \usepackage{kotex}
is sufficient to load the package, which will load fontspec as well.
Notice that kotex.sty is a file provided by cjk-ko package.

Under plain TeX:

    \input luatexko.sty

    [hangul]
Load Hangul captions. Besides, this option adjusts interword and
interline spacing. Declares \hangulpunctuations=1 as well.

    [hanja]

Hangul Font Commands
--------------------

    \setmainhangulfont
    \setsanshangulfont
    \setmonohangulfont
Equivalent to \setmainfont et. al. of fontspec package. These fonts are
used when the font loaded by \setmainfont et. al. does not have Hangul
glyphs.

    \setmainhanjafont
    \setsanshanjafont
    \setmonohanjafont
These fonts are used when the font loaded by \setmainfont or
\setmainhangulfont et. al. does not have Hanja glyphs.

    \setmainfallbackfont
    \setsansfallbackfont
    \setmonofallbackfont
These fonts are used when the font loaded by \setmainfont,
\setmainhangulfont, or \setmainhanjafont et. al. does not have Hanja
glyphs.

In like manner, these commands are available as well:

    \hangulfontspec   \newhangulfontfamily   \addhangulfontfeature
    \hanjafontspec    \newhanjafontfamily    \addhanjafontfeature
