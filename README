LuaTeX-ko Package version 4.7 (2025/09/26)
===========================================

This is a Lua(La)TeX macro package that supports typesetting Korean
documents including Old Hangul texts. As LuaTeX has opened up access to
almost all the hidden routines of TeX engine, users can obtain more
beautiful outcome using this package rather than other Hangul packages
operating on other engines.

LuaTeX version 1.10+ and luaotfload package version 2.96+ are required for
this package to run.

This package also requires cjk-ko package for its full functionality.

Loading
-------

For a LaTeX user, declaring

    \usepackage{luatexko}
or

    \usepackage{kotex}
is sufficient to load the package, which will load fontspec as well.
Notice that kotex.sty is a file provided by cjk-ko package.

Under plain TeX:

    \input luatexko.sty


Package Options
---------------

    [hangul]
Load Hangul captions. Besides, this option adjusts interword and
interline spacing. Declares \hangulpunctuations=1 as well.

    [hanja]
Load Hanja captions. Also apply other settings as [hangul] option does.


Hangul Font Commands
--------------------

    \setmainhangulfont
    \setsanshangulfont
    \setmonohangulfont
Equivalent to \setmainfont et. al. of fontspec package. These fonts are
used when the font loaded by \setmainfont et. al. does not have Hangul
glyphs.

    \setmainhanjafont
    \setsanshanjafont
    \setmonohanjafont
These fonts are used when the font loaded by \setmainfont or
\setmainhangulfont et. al. does not have Hanja glyphs.

    \setmainfallbackfont
    \setsansfallbackfont
    \setmonofallbackfont
These fonts are used when the font loaded by \setmainfont,
\setmainhangulfont, or \setmainhanjafont et. al. does not have Hanja
glyphs.

In like manner, these commands are available as well:

    \hangulfontspec   \newhangulfontfamily   \addhangulfontfeature
    \hanjafontspec    \newhanjafontfamily    \addhanjafontfeature
    \fallbackfontspec \newfallbackfontfamily \addfallbackfontfeature

If any of these CJK fonts are not specified, UnBatang/UnDotum TrueType
fonts will be used for typesetting CJK characters.


Hangul Font Options
-------------------

    [InterHangul=<dimen>]
Set spacing between Hangul characters.

    [InterLatinCJK=<dimen>]
Set spacing between CJK and Latin characters.

    [InterCharacter=<dimen>]
Set spacing between CJK characters.

    [InterCharStretch=<dimen>]
Set stretching of the glue between CJK characters.

    [CharRaise=<dimen>]
Raise CJK characters by <dimen>.

    [CompressPunctuations]
Make CJK punctuations half-width.

    [RemoveClassicSpaces]
Remove spaces between CJK characters for old document.

Other User Commands
-------------------

    \hangulpunctuations=<number>
When <number> is 1 or greater (being default value), latin punctuations
will be typeset with hangul fonts.

    \dotemph{...}
Emphasise Hangul or Hanja by putting dot above.

    \ruby{<base text>}{<ruby text>}
Typeset ruby annotations.

    \uline{...}
    \sout{...}
    \uuline{...}
    \xout{...}
    \uwave{...}
    \dashuline{...}
    \dotuline{...}
Same functionality as those ulem package provides.

    \typesetclassic
Command/environment for typesetting old document in horizontal writing mode.

    \begin{vertical}{<dimen>}
    \end{vertical}
This environment makes a box vertically typeset. <dimen> is an
argument to indicate the box height. When the <dimen> is \empty,
a box with natural height will result. For vertical writing of
entire document, use the command \verticaltypesetting instead.

    \은 \는 \이 \가 \을 \를 \와 \과 \로 \으로 \라 \이라
Commands for automatic Josa selection. Unlike those of cjk-ko
package, these commands work correctly even after Hangul or Hanja.
